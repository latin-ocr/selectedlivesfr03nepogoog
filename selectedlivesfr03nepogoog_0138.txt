PAUSANIAS.

Svrvot’sts—Pausanias defeats Mardonius at Plataea; in his
pride over the victory he acts in a way to displease the Spartans
(1). He takes Byzantium; treats with Xerxes in reference to
bringing Greece under Persian sway. He is recalled to Sparta
(2). Unbidden he returns to the army, and by his foolish con-

duct reveals his treasonable intent. Forced to return home he
attempts to get the slaves to revolt (3). Proot of his treason is
obtained by the ephors (4). His miserable death by starva-
tion (5).
