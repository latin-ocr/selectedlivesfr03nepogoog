126 Α NOTES.

dorpaneo-pou quod refers to the whole idea contained in the ex·
pression testarum romegos, hence the neuter.

5. exsilio: the Spartans, in serious plight owing to a rising
of the Helots‚ sent to Athens for help. Cimon induced the
Athenians to send troops, but as the Spartans, becoming sus-
picious of them, sent the men back, the people visited their in·
dignation upon Cimon, accusing him of being opposed to the
interests of the people and a sympathizer with Sparta. Probably
the reasons given in Milt. 8, 1, in the case of the father, apply
here also in the case of the son.

5. celerius: not strictly true, as Cimon wished to rejoin his
countrymen at the battle of Tanagra (see below), but was not
allowed to do so. “

6. paenituit: impersonal as always; followed by accus. ‘and
gen.

·7. bellumque Lacedaemonii: the schemes of Pericles for ex-
tending Athenian sway over upper Greece received a check in the
defeat of the Athenians at Tanagra in Boeotia (458) by a Spartan
force ; after the victory the Spartans returned to Peloponnesus.

10. Post: separated from quam by tmesis; thus frequently
priusquam, antequam always translate as one word at the point
where qnam comes in the text.

ro. expulsus erat: the perfect indicative usually follows poet·
quam; but whenever a definite amount of time is given, the plu-
perfect is used. Cimon was'recalled in 457 ; the five years’ peace
was not arranged till 451.

11. hospitio: almost all Greek states had their guest-friend·
ships. The so-called πρόξενοι, hospites, performed a duty sorne-
what similar to that of our modern consuls; but this difference
is to be noted ε the American consul at Liverpool eg. is an Ameri-
can citizen who takes up his residence there when appointed; the
Spartan representative at Athens was an Athenian. He, how·
ever, was expected to help and befriend any Lacedaemonian who
came to Athens. See on hospitium, p. 16, l. 11.

¹3· ani sponte: i.e. not sent officially; cs. the same words
in p. 22, l. 5.
