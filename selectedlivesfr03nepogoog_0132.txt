108 NOTES.

r. illos: i.e.‚ the ephors, subject of mittere, which has viriis
for object. ’

3· se: ie, Themistocles.

4. retinerent: in the principal clause in indirect discourse‚
representing an imperative (G. 3393 H. 52 3. HL).

4· (tentus est ei mos: ln's suggestion wasfollowed; rnore liter·
ally‚ his way was done.

7. praedixit: warned them besorelzand; pree has its own force
iu this compound, while dixit has borrowed some of the force of
idssit, and takes the construction of verbs of heading, urging.

7. ut ne: equivalent to ne alone, common in Cicero, rare else
where.

rr. liberrime: with perfect frankness.

12. quod . . . possent: we should not look for this clause till
after saepsisse, which, with the rest of the clause to which it be-
longs, serves as the antecedent; perhaps it is brought in early to
disarm in part the wrath of the Lacedaemoniam.

12. debs pirblicds: the gods worshiped everywhere in Greece;
patrios those worshiped in Attica proper; penites, those of
each family.

14. detenderet Themistocles cleverly words it as if the object
in building the walls were simply the defense of the gods; in eo:
refers to miros saepsisse3 supply quicquam before quod intitsse.

16. ut: as.

16. oppositum: conforms in gender to the emphatic predicate
appositive propdgnteulum instead of to urbem. ⁴

17. apud quam iam bis: ie, through the battles of Marathon
and Salamis ; the expression is a figurative one with no especiai
reference to fighting on sea as opposed to fighting on land;
epud quam=et apud eam, hence the infinitive construction is
continued.

¹7· regitis: in narrating Greek history, rex and regius unquali-
fied are constantly used of the king of Persia and his concerns.

19 qui = cum ii, causal clause since they.

22. si: ic.. Themistocles.

22. remitterent: cf note on retinerent in l. 4, above.
