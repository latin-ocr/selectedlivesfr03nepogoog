substance of the charge against Alcibiades; the subjunctive
places it on the authority of the accusers (G. 3²¹3 H. 516, ΙΙ,).

18. reum: ia, no formal charge was brought till he had gone;
the talk against himin the assembly just before his departure
was not a legal accusation. Reus means one having to do with
a ris which, technically, was an action at law ; then it was limited
to defendant.

²3· Tatnos in italiam: the Latin allows two expressions of
limit of motion where the English admits but one. We say ‘to

country has the preposition, while the town in precisely the same
construction omits it. (G. 2 58 and b; H. 380, l. and ΙΙ,). ’
Thurii was an Athenian colony in lower Italy.
