156 NOTES.

1 5. ηδ . . . aliquis: more emphatic than ni . . .quis (G. 105d,
note; H. 4 5 5, 1) and strongly suggesting that by aliquis Diome
don himself is meant.

16. ereptum: Epaminondas means‘to imply that if Diomedon
should be robbed when going away from Thebes, he would spread
the report that Epaminondas himself, having with a show of
virtue refused his offer of money, had had him robbed of it.

17. delatum: as a present, lit. being effecti.

19. Athenas: accus. expressing limit of motion after εδ dietrici
velle to be supplied.

20. Neque verb = niu νόῐός see on neque verti, p. 33, l. 2ο.

zo. id satis habuit: was (not) satisfied with llus.

21. ut escenderet: e'.e., to sail from Athens to Asia; a result
clause depending on efficit.

24. possumus: we might, as if subjunctive.

25. volumine: it was usual ior each book to be written
upon a separate roll, but in case of great length more were' used,
that each roll might not be bullty. Notice the etymology and
compare volume in English. (See Fig.9 after note on vincla
epistulae, p. 23, l. 13, showing a case of these rolls.)

Pane 46. 1. quorum: sc. vitam the Latin rarely puts ab
straet or semi-abstract nouns in the plural; but we may translate
by the English plural.

1. separatim: the description of each occupying an entire
volumen.

1. versuum: note etymology, see groupvnnr·. As the books

were written on sheets fastened together in long strips and rolled, l

the ancients used to number roll (volumen) and line (versus).

3. ut nemo : this seems slight praise if we compare l. 8, below3 Ἴ

but chap. 6 makes it clear that Nepos means to praise highly the ¹

oratory of Epaminondas. ἵ
3. nemi) Thebanus: see on ut nemi, etc, p. 42, l. 19.
4. neque: and to be sure not ; see on post, p. 28, l. t 5.

4. concinnus: apt. Three examples of these apt replies y

follow.
