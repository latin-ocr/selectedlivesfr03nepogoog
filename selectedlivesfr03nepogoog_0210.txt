186 NOTES.

10. iterum consulem: this should read (Gracchum) bis con-
sulem and below Marcellum quintum consulem, for Gracchus was
killed aster the expiration oi his second, Marcellus during his
fifth consulship.

ιο. inLucinis: join with austrum see on per Liguras, p.69,l. 6.

10. absens: aa, through his brother Mago.

13. Longum est: it would be tediaus, an expression of propriety
taking the indicative in Latin, but trans. as if the subjunct.
(G. 311 c).

14. ex qud: ut ex eo.

15.quamdii1 . . . posuit: he was not defeated in Italy (it
we accept Nola). The rest of the statement is absurd¹

18. defensum: cf helmoretum, p. 1, l. 10.

18. revocatus: 203.

19. P. scipionem: ie„ P. cornelius scipio, to which the
agnomen Africanus was added aiter his deleat ol Hannibal. He
conquered all Spain between 210 and 206. In ²04 he went over
to Africa from Sicily and won a great battle near Utica, which
occasioned the recall of Hannibal.

22. impraesentiarum: an adverb equivalent to in praesentia,
p. 8, l. 6; a colloquial expression probably from in praesentii
rerum.

²3· bellum componere: cf. bellum oompositurum, p. 37, l. 20.

24. In conloquium convenit, eta: a conserence is agreed upon ;
an terms tlzey did erut agree (lit. terms did nat meet).

2 5- Post io factum: asartauaok place, nt. aseerthisdeed.

26. Zamam: this was southwest of Carthage. Itis thought
that Naraggara, which lay fifty miles to the west oi Zama, was
the scene of the battle ; the armies had encamped there prior to
the colloquy. Hadrumetum was not over one hundred miles
from Zama, one hundred aud fifty from Naraggara; hence the
statement trecenta milia is au exaggeration.

Paqe 71. abest ab Zama: abis used even with names of
towns when the distance from one place to another is stated.
8. acerrimi occupatus: most actiaely engaged. ·
