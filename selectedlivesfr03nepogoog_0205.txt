Paqe 66. 1. Hannibal, eta: cs. p. 9, l. 1, with note.

2. quod: ordinarily we find the abl. with de atter anunm
neuter pronouns in the accus. form the only exceptions.

3· ut. . . superarit: (for superaverit) a result clause where
an accus. and inl. would be more regular after verum est (G. 332 l;
= H.501‚1‚2).

3. infitiandum: prejudiced Romans might easily do this ; later

several statues of Hannibal were set up at Rome.

4. ceteris: we should expect ceteris (dat.); see on omues,
p. 47, l. 7. In one tale Hannibal is represented as claiming only
third place, putting Alexander the Great and Pyrrhus before
himself.

6. antecedat: this is subjunct. by attraction from its depen-
dence on the inf. praestitisse (G. 34²5 H. 529, ΙΙ).

7. congressus est. . . discessit: sc. Hannibal for subject of
tltese. Hannibal did meet with one repulse at the hands of
Marcellus when he attacked Nola, a Campanian city, in ²¹4·
This was a mere trifle compared with the long list of Hannibal's
victories‚ but the Romans made a great deal of it.

8. Quod: therefore,

9. domi: i.e., while Hannibal was in the field. He certainly
was not properly supported by his countrymen at home3 but the
fact that the Romans had a number of generals who were more
than a malch for any Carthaginian leader other than Hannibal
had much to do with his failure.

11. virtutem: ability.
