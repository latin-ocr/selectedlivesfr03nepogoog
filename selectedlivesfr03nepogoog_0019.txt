In this comparison or balancing oi his countrymen with
foreigners we should naturally Iook for some disparage-
ment of the latter. But everywhere in the portions of his
work that have come down to us, we are forced to recog-
nize his iairness and impartiality. Even when a foreigner

gaIns his glory at the expense of Romans as was true oi
Hahnibal‚ Nepos shows the highest admiration for his
exploits and in no way attempts to belittle his achieve-
ments.

We find many mistakes and inaccuracies in his historical
statementS‚ but in view of the great task he undertook‚ of
his haste to finish the work begun only late in life, and
of his being the first Roman historiari to use foreign
authorities, this need not excite our surprise. »
