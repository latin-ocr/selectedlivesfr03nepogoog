Pnsrncu. vii

The aim iu the notes has been to supply needed infor·
matiou where Nepos is over-brief or in error, to explain
real difficulties in syntax, and to add to the pupil's interest
by giving illustrations of objeets mentioned in the text
The editions ol Nepos by Nipperdey (Lupus), Siebelis
(Jancovius) and Karl Erbe have been drawn upon in the
preparation ol the notes.

References have been made to the grammars of Allen
and Greenough‚ and Harkness. That these references
will be found less frequent than in many elementary text·
books is due to the editor's belief that constant references
to the grammar often prove interruptions rather than helps
to the pupils,

It remains for the editor to express his indebtedness to
the editors-inchief of this series, Messrs. William C. Collar
and John Tetlow. Their assistance has been constant
while the book was going through the press, and theirX
suggestions and criticisms many and valuable.
