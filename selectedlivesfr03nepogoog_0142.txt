118 NOTES.

first period of his presence, as then he held command3 every·
thing else he may and probably did continue.
14. locus: properly an appositive with colonas, but it has been

attracted, as is usual in Latin, into the relative clause and agrees
with the relative.

15. cum . . . tum: not only. . . but also.

17. clivi: this has reference to cylindrical pieces of wood
possessed by the ephors, and carried by all generals on expedi-

tions. It was usual for the ephors to winda narrow strip of
leather slantwise around the wooden cylinder, and then to write
short secret dispatches lengthwise upon the leather. When the
leather was unrolled, merely a series of single letters appeared,
having no consecutive meaning. The officer receiving it would
wind it about a precisely similar cylinder, thus learning its con-
tents. The cylinder and the message could each be called scytale,
of which clava staff is a literal translation ; in the present instance
the strip of leather written upon is meant, so use scytale in trans-
lating.

17. more illorum: perhaps referring to the scytale 'as just
described; but as brevity and pithiness, to which they were

usual way, i.e., with laconic (note the origin of our word) brevity,
seems a better interpretation. 1t also accords well with the
message following.

20. potentii: remember the distinction between this and
imperium.

zo. iustine: neuter; qualifies periculum.

22. licet: should be a past tense as in the time of Nepos
there were no longer kings at Sparta.

²3· ebrum: i.e., Laoedaemonidrum.

²3· regi: Pausanias was regent for Pleistarchus, the son of
leonidas, and consequently enjoyed a king's rights.

26. quod . . . vocatur: this might have been qui . . amantur,
attracted to Hildtae; see on qui, p. 5, l, 6.

Paqe 23. 1. Hilotae: slaves, tillers of the soil for the
individual Spartans, probably they were descendants of those of
