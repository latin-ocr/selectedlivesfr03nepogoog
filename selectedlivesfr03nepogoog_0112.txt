88 NOTES.

a. oppido: urhe would be better, as he means Athens; there
was a village as well as a plain oi Marathon. Oppidum is rarely
used oi a capital city ; once by Livy, and several times by Nepos.

2. passuum: not by our reckoning; pace with us is the same
as step, the space included between the feet in walking. The
Roman pace was double oms, the space passed over between the
footialls of the same foot. Yet the Roman mile was somewhat
shorter than ours. Ι

3.tumulti1: used by the Romans particularly of a rebellion
or insurrection right at home, and consequently dangerous.
Hence it is chosen here to lay stress upon the suddenness and

, danger of this bellum.
4. Lacedaemoniis: as the most powerful state in Greece; the

Argives alone ot the Peloponnesians did not follow the Lace·
daemonian standard in war. Both Scythians and Ionians had
appeaied to the Spartans for help against the Persians‚ but in
vain.

6. qui: the relative is attracted into agreement with its predi-

cate appositive hemerodromoe, instead oi being quod to conform
to its antecedent generis.

6. hemerodromoe: Greek noun of second deciens. (G. 43, d;
H. 54, note 1). Keep the same word in English. The perform-
ances of some of these runners were most extraordinary. Alter
the battle ol Plataea. one oi thern ran from the battlefield to
Delphi and back (perhaps 112 miles altogether) in one day. In
the present instance Phidippus reached Sparta (more than 125
miles distant) on the second day.

8. auxilio: why abl? (G. 243, e; H. 414, Ν).

8. creant: why present? Cſs revertitur, p. 2, l. 21.

8. praeteris: not comparable to the Roman officials ot class-

ical times, but as in the earliest use oi the word from its ety- ’

mology, leaders, generals; see group 1-; Ascon. on Cic. Verres 1,
· 14, says: Veteres, omnes magistratus quibus pareret exercitus,
praetores appellaverunt. The qui. . ,praeessent seems to be
added to. prevent misunderstanding of Nepos' use of the term.
Ten generals were chosen yearly.
