INTRODUCTlON.

...000—

an details of the life of Cornelius Nepos have come
down to us; even his praenomen is unknown. The date
100 nc. is generally fixed upon as approximafely the year
of his birth, Ticinum in Cis-Alpine Gaul (the modern
Pavia in Northern Italy) as his birthplace. Early in life
he removed to Romej where he was educated. A‘con-
temporary of Caesar and Cicero, he became well acquainted
with the latter through their common friend Atticus. With
this Atticus (Titus Pomponius Atticus), best known to us
as the friend and correspondent of Cicero, Nepos became
very intimate, and, entertaining for him the highest admi-
ration, he imitated his tastes and manner of living. Like
Atticus he held aloof from political life, filled none of the
offices of state, and, being possessed of sufficient means,
devoted himself to literary pursuits. The date of his·
death is uncertain; it cannot have been earlier than
29 ae. and probably was somewhat later. He is said to
have published the following works:

1. Chronica, probablya chronological summary which included
the history of outside nations as well as of Rome.

2. Exempla; models for imitation, drawn from the early
Romans whose simplicity of life afforded a great con-
trast with the luxury of N epos' own time.
